# Parameters for smoothFit
# 

# a file containing a 2D vector field on the same grid that the smoothFit will be
# performed on.  The actual contents of the field are not important, just the grid itself.
# (This method for defining the grid was chosen becuase it allows the reuse of ACCIV code.)
inGridFileName = grid.h5

# the input file name for the scattered vectors
inScatteredFieldFileName = scatteredField.h5

# the output file name for the smooth, grid field
outGridFieldFileName = gridField.h5

# the minimum number of scattered data points that neighbor a given b-spline control point, 
# below which the control point is dropped from the fit
smoothFitMinControlPointScatteredNeighbors = 16
